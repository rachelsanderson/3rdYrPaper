\midrule 
Anderson et al. (2019) & GMM & Linked dataset with multiple matches $(x_i, \{y_{i\ell}\}_{\ell=1}^{L_i})_{i=1}^n$ & Datasets are random samples conditional on the matching variables; each $x_i$ has exactly one true link among its matched outcomes $\{y_{i\ell}\}_{\ell=1}^{L_i}$, and each $y_{i\ell}$ is equally likely to be the correct match& Rewrite the moments as a difference between the sum of the moments for all possible links and a conditional expectation of the moment function based on $i$'s identifying variables; estimation and variance estimation proceed as standard  2-step semiparametric GMM problem  \\
\midrule 
Lahiri and Larsen (2005) & GLM & Files A and B, linked via Fellegi-Sunter/EM algorithm method  &  Each record in File A has exactly one true link in File B; distribution of matching variables is independent of the response variable &  Apply OLS to a transformed regression model constructed using parameter estimates from the Fellegi-Sunter/EM algorithm method; estimate the variance using parametric bootstrap  \\ 
\midrule
Scheuren and Winkler (1991, 1993, 1997) & GLM & tbd & & Propose a bias correction for OLS, using a weighted average of responses from all observations and the actual response $y_i$  \\

Hirukawa and Prokhorov (2018) & GLM & Nearest-neighbor matching (Unique matches only) & The samples jointly identify the regression models & Bias correction for nearest-neighbor matched samples; could be used if we define an appropriate metric for matching variables and use a nearest neighbor matching rule\\
\midrule
Goldstein et al., 2012 & GLM  & & & Combine probabilistic record linkage with multiple imputation using a latent normal model that allows for unordered categorical variables  \\

Anderson (2019) & GMM & Files A and B, linked via Fellegi-Sunter EM method & Want to relax the assumption where matching variables are independent of the response varaible
