 abstract = {Record linkage, or exact matching, can be used to join together two files that contain information on the same individuals but lack unique personal identification codes. The possibility of errors in linkage causes problems for estimating the relationships between variables on the two files. The effect is analogous to the impact of measurement error. A model of a linear regression relationship between variables in linked files is proposed. Assuming the probabilities that pairs of records are links are known, an unbiased estimator of the regression coefficients is derived. Methods for estimating the linkage probabilities by using mixture models are discussed. A consistent estimator of the covariance matrix of the proposed estimator is proposed. A bootstrap estimator is used to reflect the impact of the uncertainty in record linkage model parameters on the estimators of the regression parameters. A simulation study compares the performance of the proposed estimator and alternatives.},

 abstract = {Linking individuals across historical datasets relies on information such as name and age that is both non-unique and prone to enumeration and transcription errors. These errors make it impossible to find the correct match with certainty. In the first part of the paper, we suggest a fully automated probabilistic method for linking historical datasets that enables researchers to create samples at the frontier of minimizing type I (false positives) and type II (false negatives) errors. The first step guides researchers in the choice of which variables to use for linking. The second step uses the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, a standard tool in statistics, to compute the probability that each two records correspond to the same individual. The third step suggests how to use these estimated probabilities to choose which records to use in the analysis. In the second part of the paper, we apply the method to link historical population censuses in the US and Norway, and use these samples to estimate measures of intergenerational occupational mobility. The estimates using our method are remarkably similar to the ones using IPUMS?, which relies on hand linking to create a training sample. We created an R code and a Stata command that implement this method.},

 abstract = {This paper reviews the literature in historical record linkage in the U.S. and examines the performance of widely-used automated record linking algorithms in two high-quality historical datasets and one synthetic ground truth. Focusing on algorithms in current practice, our findings highlight the important effects of linking methods on data quality. We find that (1) no method (including hand-linking) consistently produces representative samples; (2) 15 to 37 percent of links chosen by prominent machine linking algorithms are identified as false links by human reviewers; and (3) these false links are systematically related to baseline sample characteristics, suggesting that machine algorithms may introduce complicated forms of bias into analyses. We find that prominent linking algorithms attenuate estimates of the intergenerational income elasticity by up to 20 percent and common variations in algorithm choices result in greater attenuation. These results recommend that current practice could be improved by placing more emphasis on reducing false links and less emphasis on increasing match rates. We conclude with constructive suggestions for reducing linking errors and directions for future research.},

Prior cross-sectional work finds that immigrants initially held lower-paid occupations than natives but converged over time. In newly assembled panel data, we show that, in fact, the average immigrant did not face a substantial occupation-based earnings penalty upon first arrival and experienced occupational advancement at the same rate as natives. Cross-sectional patterns are driven by biases from declining arrival cohort skill level and departures of negatively selected return migrants. We show that assimilation patterns vary substantially across sending countries and persist in the second generation.},

Norwegian immigrants who returned to Norway held lower-paid occupations than did Norwegian immigrants who stayed in the United States, both before and after their first transatlantic migration, suggesting they were negatively selected from the migrant pool. Upon returning to Norway, return migrants held higher-paid occupations relative to Norwegians who never moved, despite hailing from poorer backgrounds. These patterns suggest that despite being negatively selected, return migrants had been able to accumulate savings and could improve their economic circumstances once they returned home. }

In this paper, we demonstrate that the ordinary least squares estimator of the linear regression model using matched samples is inconsistent and has a non-standard convergence rate to its probability limit. If only a few variables are used to impute the missing data, then it is possible to correct for the bias. We propose two semiparametric bias-corrected estimators and explore their asymptotic properties. The estimators have an indirect-inference interpretation, and they attain the parametric convergence rate when the number of matching variables is no greater than four. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the bias correction works very well in such cases."

abstract = {In record linkage studies, unique identifiers are often not available, and therefore, the linkage procedure depends on combinations of partially identifying variables with low discriminating power. As a consequence, wrongly linked covariate and outcome pairs will be created and bias further analysis of the linked data. In this article, we investigated two estimators that correct for linkage error in regression analysis. We extended the estimators developed by Lahiri and Larsen and also suggested a weighted least squares approach to deal with linkage error. We considered both linear and logistic regression problems and evaluated the performance of both methods with simulations. Our results show that all wrong covariate and outcome pairs need to be removed from the analysis in order to calculate unbiased regression coefficients in both approaches. This removal requires strong assumptions on the structure of the data. In addition, the bias significantly increases when the assumptions do not hold and wrongly linked records influence the coefficient estimation. Our simulations showed that both methods had similar performance in linear regression problems. With logistic regression problems, the weighted least squares method showed less bias. Because the specific structure of the data in record linkage problems often leads to different assumptions, it?is necessary that the analyst has prior knowledge on the nature of the data. These assumptions are more easily introduced in the weighted least squares approach than in the Lahiri and Larsen estimator. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This is the case if there is no single sample that contains all relevant variables. A special case occurs if longitudinal or panel data are needed but only repeated cross-sections are available. In this chapter we survey sample combination. If two (or more) samples from the same population are combined, there are variables that are unique to one of the samples and variables that are observed in each sample. What can be learned by combining such samples, depends on the nature of the samples, the assumptions that one is prepared to make, and the goal of the analysis. The most ambitious objective is the identification and estimation of the joint distribution, but often we settle for the estimation of economic models that involve these variables or a subset thereof. Sometimes the goal is to reduce biases due to mismeasured variables. We consider sample merger by matching on identifiers that may be imperfect in the case that the two samples have a substantial number of common units. For the case that the two samples are independent, we consider (conditional) bounds on the joint distribution. Exclusion restrictions will narrow these bounds. We also consider inference under the strong assumption of conditional independence.},
